# Project Plan

Feature roadmap and milestones. Auto-generated by `/dm-init` or filled manually.

## Vision

One sentence describing what the project achieves for users.

## Goals

1. **Primary Goal**: Main objective the project must achieve
2. **Secondary Goal**: Supporting objectives
3. **Success Metric**: How success will be measured (e.g., "10K users in 6 months")

## Milestones

### Phase 1: MVP
**Target:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Goal:** Minimal viable product to validate core hypothesis

- [ ] User authentication (signup, login, logout)
- [ ] Core feature 1
- [ ] Core feature 2
- [ ] Basic UI/UX
- [ ] Deploy to production

### Phase 2: Growth Features
**Target:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Goal:** Features that drive user acquisition and retention

- [ ] Feature 3
- [ ] Feature 4
- [ ] Analytics integration
- [ ] Email notifications

### Phase 3: Scale
**Target:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Goal:** Handle increased load and add advanced features

- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Advanced feature 5
- [ ] API for third-party integrations
- [ ] Mobile app (optional)

## Features

### Core Features (MVP)
| Feature | Priority | Status | Owner | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| User Auth | High | Planned | - | OAuth + email/password |
| Dashboard | High | Planned | - | Main user interface |
| Data CRUD | High | Planned | - | Create, read, update, delete |

### Nice-to-Have (Post-MVP)
| Feature | Priority | Status | Owner | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|-------|
| Dark Mode | Medium | Backlog | - | Theme toggle |
| Export Data | Low | Backlog | - | CSV/JSON export |
| Webhooks | Low | Backlog | - | Third-party integrations |

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Database Choice
- **Decision:** PostgreSQL with Supabase
- **Reason:** Managed hosting, built-in auth, real-time subscriptions
- **Alternatives Considered:** MongoDB (less relational), MySQL (fewer features)

### Decision 2: Frontend Framework
- **Decision:** Next.js with App Router
- **Reason:** SSR for SEO, React ecosystem, Vercel deployment
- **Alternatives Considered:** Nuxt (Vue), SvelteKit (smaller ecosystem)

### Decision 3: Hosting
- **Decision:** Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend if separate)
- **Reason:** Easy deployment, good free tier, auto-scaling
- **Alternatives Considered:** AWS (more complex), Cloudflare (newer)

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Scope creep | High | High | Strict MVP definition, feature prioritization |
| Technical debt | Medium | Medium | Code reviews, refactoring sprints |
| Third-party dependency issues | Medium | Low | Use established providers, have fallbacks |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Regular audits, security reviews |

## Dependencies

### External Services
- Supabase (database, auth)
- Vercel (hosting)
- Stripe (payments, if applicable)
- Resend (email, if applicable)

### Internal Dependencies
```
Auth → must complete before any protected features
Database schema → must finalize before API development
API → must complete before frontend integration
```

## Success Criteria

### MVP Success
- [ ] Core features functional
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Response time < 500ms (p95)
- [ ] 10+ beta users testing

### Phase 2 Success
- [ ] 100+ active users
- [ ] User retention > 30% (week 1)
- [ ] Positive user feedback

### Phase 3 Success
- [ ] Handles 1000+ concurrent users
- [ ] 99.9% uptime
- [ ] Revenue positive (if applicable)
