# Everything Claude Code

**Multi-model agent orchestration for Claude Code with intelligent configuration and workflow management.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install plugin
/plugin install everything-claude-code

# 2. Initialize for your project
/setup

# 3. Start building
# Example: "Add user authentication"
# Example: "Create a dashboard page"
```

That's it! The `/setup` command will interview you about your project and automatically configure everything.

---

## Features

- **🎯 Smart Initialization**: `/setup` command configures your project automatically
- **🤖 24 Specialized Agents**: Optimal model assignments (40% token savings)
- **⚡ Two Modes**: Auto (flexible) or Structured (predefined workflows)
- **📊 Multi-Model**: Opus 4.5, Gemini 3, GLM-4.7, GPT-5.2
- **💰 Cost Optimized**: Intelligent model selection saves tokens
- **🔧 Reconfigurable**: Change settings anytime with `/setup`

---

## Configuration

All configuration happens in **two files**:

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** (your project) - Generated by `/setup`
   - Your tech stack
   - Workflow preferences
   - Custom rules

2. **`config/stack.yaml`** (your project) - Auto-configured
   - Model assignments
   - Stack versions

**Do not modify this plugin's `README.md`** - it's just documentation.
**Do modify your project's `CLAUDE.md`** - it's your configuration.

## MCP Setup (One-Time)

Add to `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gemini": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "github:aliargun/mcp-server-gemini"],
      "env": { "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your-key" }
    },
    "openai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mzxrai/mcp-openai@latest"],
      "env": { "OPENAI_API_KEY": "your-key" }
    },
    "glm": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@zhipuai/mcp-server"],
      "env": { "ZHIPUAI_API_KEY": "your-key" }
    }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

```
User Request
     ↓
Orchestrator analyzes
     ↓
├─ Auto Mode: Creates plan on-the-fly
└─ Structured Mode: Uses predefined workflow
     ↓
Agents execute (with optimal models)
     ↓
Checkpoints for review
     ↓
Done!
```

## Usage

### Automatic Execution

Everything runs automatically. Just make a request and the system handles it:

```
You: "Add user authentication"

System:
✓ Analyzing request...
✓ Starting PM agent (progress tracking)
✓ Using feature-development workflow (4 phases, est. $3-8)
✓ Phase 1: Planning (2 min)
✓ Phase 2: Backend (5 min)
✓ Phase 3: Frontend (4 min)
✓ Phase 4: Testing (3 min)
✅ Complete! See .plans/WORK_LOG.md for details
```

The system only stops for **critical decisions** (architecture choices, security issues, destructive operations).

### Manual Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/setup` | Initialize or reconfigure project |
| `/status` | Check current progress with visual charts |
| `/plan` | View current project plan |
| `/log` | See work history |
| `/stop` | Halt automatic execution |
| `/help` | Context-aware help |
| **Agent Invocation** | |
| `/frontend-engineer` | Invoke specific agent manually |
| `/backend-engineer` | Invoke backend agent |
| `/architect` | Invoke architect for design |
| _(any agent name)_ | Call any of the 24 agents directly |
| **Workflow Invocation** | |
| `/feature-development` | Use feature development workflow |
| `/code-review` | Use code review workflow |

### Progress Tracking

The PM agent automatically creates documentation:
- `.plans/PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Project timeline with Mermaid charts
- `.plans/WORK_LOG.md` - Detailed work history
- `.plans/features/` - Per-feature progress tracking

## Example Session

```
You: /setup

Atlas: Let's configure your project!

What's your stack?
- Language: TypeScript 5.3
- Frontend: Next.js 14
- Backend: Node.js (Next.js API routes)
- Database: PostgreSQL

Complexity? Medium
Team? Solo
Skill level? Intermediate

⚙️ Optimizing...

✅ Done! Created:
- CLAUDE.md (your project config)
- stack.yaml (optimized models)

Ready! Try: "Add user authentication"
```
